General-plot-for-difference-lines
=================================

This repository is represent for working on multi-line TRL calibration (M-TRL).

Each lines standard of the M-TRL plot is used HFSS simulation data from the designed ISC (film substrate meterial).

Other hand, there is another comparing calibration response that is more simple for general simple design, de-embedding.
